# sino-capital

`npm install`
`npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`

un-solicited re-design of https://www.sinoglobalcapital.com/

Features:

- language specific collections
- locales managed using directory data files
- a date filter taking locales into account
- a language switcher based on a `translationKey` set in YAML front matters



Notes:

Logo being designed on Twitter. None selected yet. 

We will build the website.

I propose we use 11ty, of course, and proceed to make a lightening fast website.


Here is a home page mock-up by [@redmanbravemm](https://twitter.com/redmanbravemm):

*We will explore more styles too.*
